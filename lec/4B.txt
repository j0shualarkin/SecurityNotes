/// Wrapping up authentication & starting access control

challenge and resoinse can also use timestamps

----

Kerberos
 * trusted 3rd party authe. protoclol designed for tcp/ip networks
   - based on Needham-Schroeder + timestamp

 * kerberos ticket
   - an authe./access control token with uername service, time and control info

 * actors in kerberos system
    - clients 
    - kerberos server
    - ticket-granting server
    - other servers

Initiating a Kerberos session
- Alice wants to log-in to email account

1. alice to kerberos server: send identity
2. kerberos retrieve privilege and secret dervied from her password 
3. ticket-granting server gen. session key 
4. kerberos send ticket and session key to alice
   (ticket is privileges and what server she can access)
   message is sent encrypted via a password (or secret dervied from pw)
5. kerberos sends session key to ticket-granting server
   encrypted under KS-TGS key

obtain a ticket to access a server

alice sends request to access F, and her ticket
TGS gen. another session key for server F , and a ticket encrypted under key TGS-F 
alice sends request for service and ticket to otherservice F 
  (message encry. under the newest session key)

Security Strengths of Kerberos
* no password passing on network
* protect against spoofing
* limited peroid of validity
* time stamp to rpevent replay attack
* provide mutual authe.

Vulernabilities
* require continuous availability of a trusted TGS
* require a trusted relation b/t TGS and F
* require timely transactions
* a subverted workstation saves password
* password guessing works
* kerberos does not scale well

         Access Control
===================================
Defn: a process by which use of system resources is regulated according to a security 
policy and is permitted only by authorized entities (users, programs processes, or other systems) 
according to that policy

(another defn)
process of granting or denying specific requests to: 
  1. obtain and use info and rleated ifo processing serves
  2. enter specific physical facility

access control policy - set of rules that dictate type of access which are permitted and by whom
type of access - read write execute 
when you can access
by whome

Categories                            -- Based On 
Discretionary access control    (DAC) -- identity of requestor, access rules
Mandatory acces control         (MAC) -- comparing security labels with security clearances
Role-based aces control        (RBAC) -- user role in the system, access of role
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) -- attributes of user, target resource, system's environmental conditions


=====

Basic Elements Of Access Control

subject wants to gain access to an object and have some rights with that object

1. subject (entity capable of accessing objects)
  - owner , group , world

2. object (resource to which access is controlled)
  - e.g., records, blocks, pages, segments, files, ...

3. access right (the way win which a sbject may access an object)
  - e.g., read, write, execute, delete, create, search


Two types of access contro lschemes

discretionary
 - owner of object can decide who can access that object
 - enforce the specified access control
 - owner can set access rules/policy


mandatory
 - when u are owner, u wont be able to set a rule
 - policy set by 3rd party


=====
Military seucirty policy
- enforce both _sensitivity_ and _need to know_ requirements 
- example of mandatory access control

sensitivity  
 - classify info into several ranks
     + unclassified, restricted, confidential, secret, top secret 
 - higher-level info is more sensitive

need to know
 - only party associted with project needs to know info 
    "comparments"
 - restrict projects to a specific compartment


clearance : classification of a subject (person) seeking info 
dominance relation : a subject can access object iff their rank is at least as large as rank of object 
  and compartment of the subject must include the compartment of the object

? access policies 
 - the clearance lvel ..............

just because you have the clearance, 
  if you are not trying to access a compartment/project, 
  you don't get to know anything on (or below) your clearance level

====
discretionary access control
 - most generic mechanism is access control matrix 
   - used by OS and database mgmt system
 - matrix structure:  
    colm for objects  (files, memory, comp. resources)
    rows for subjects (users, programs, ...)
    access control policies are presented in intersections
 - wastes a lot of space 
    + have to enumerate for all objects and subjects
    + lots of time subject has nothing to do with object 
    + large memory requirements 

Access control lists (ACL) and capabilities

ACL
 - essentially, 1 colm of acces scontrol matrix 
 - represent access of an ojbect
 - pros:
    use with data-oriented policies
    simple implemntation
 - cons:
   removing a user is expensive
      go thru each file, remove their name from each file 
   difficult to delegate rights
