================================================
What is security? Lecture
================================================

1. protect information assets from intentional human misuses
2. information assets: valuable computing resources
    * hardware (cpu, disk, network adapter card, etc...)
    * software (os, utils, apps)
    * data (files, db, passwords)
    * communicaiton facilities and networks (link, bridge, router)

================================================
Security concerns
================================================

1. information assets could be easily abused
 -- break into your systems to steal confidential data
 -- destroy your valuable files
 -- spy your communication
 -- squander your resources

People can get access to your devices

Princple of easiest penetration (Maginot Line)
 -- an intruder must be expected to use any available means of penetration, 
    not necessarily from the most obvious one or the one against the most solid defense
 -- there are alternatives to breaking encryption without having the key...


================================================
Vulnerability, Threat, Risk and Attack (RFC4949)
================================================

Vulnerability: 
  - make assumption about attacker's capability and intention 
  - given this, and access to your system, can they inflict damage?
  - def: weakness in the security system 
  - apache server/client allow remote desktop access 
     attacker can send a request to your server? they can attack you
     request can contain attack code/data 
       -- when you read it into the server, you render control to the attacker
  - corruption, leakage and unavailability
  - e.g., software bugs, defense holes...
 
Threat: a set of circumstances that has the potential to 
 cause exploit of vulnerabilities and damages to information assets

Risk: Loss as the probability that threat causes harm 
  - the chance an evil plan (launched against you) would be succeessful
  - "probabilisitc chance of loss"

Attack : an assult on system that derives from a threat

Example: TCP 3-Way Handshake
  - purpose: establish a channel for service and client 
  - approach makes sense as long as client always does good
  - but this is a vulnerability
 
  - by not committing to the ACK packet, 
    client can force server to keep a block of unused memory (for a period of time)
    -- if enough memory gets taken up/not used then 
       it can all be expended and the server wont take 
       in new (potentially good) clients
  - ^^ the potential threat: deny service of the server ^^
  
  - risk: if the server goes down, there will be some loss 
     -- level of loss depends on the server 
     -- could be days, could lose millions of dollars

  - attack: syn-flooding
     -- adversary uses all of the server's resources 

    3Way Handshake:
Reminder, how it works:
client sends SYN packet to server
server sends SYN-ACK packet to client 
  (sets aside a chunk of memory for when client followsup; 
   so server has a spot to keep the communication data)*
client sends ACK packet to server

*half-open queue

================================================
Attack Surfaces
================================================

attack surface depends on assumption about attacker

* reachable and exploitable vuleranilities
* general categories:
  - network surface: e.g., open ports, services on the inside of a firewall
  - software surface: e.g., code that processes incoming data
  - human surface: gullible employee gives access to sensitive data 

"thumbstick" (combo of "usb stick" and "thumbdrive")

usb ports on cars are unsafe
you can write something that pretends to be a device 
  and reads all the communications within the car
      since theres no encryption within the car
ultimately this could be a serious threat as someone could take control of the car 

BUT this ^^ may not be an attack surface  *****


the assumption is that they must enter the door first (all protection is on door)
but if you can break the door open, you could leave a bomb there and not hack the car at all

the model has a premier assumption that they must get in the door
this is separate from internet
"as long as they secure the door, the car is secure"
vulnerable but unreachable (as long as door is protected)

***** because it is not a reachable vulnerability in the manufacturers model?

================================================
Threats
================================================

Unauthorized disclosure
 - Exposure
 - Inference 
   -- unique feature to figure out which packet is which,
   -- one common thing is to know the packet size
 - Interception
 - Intrusion

Deception (false data accepted as true)
 - Masquerade
 - Falsification
 - Repudiation

Disruption (aiming at availability or integrity)
 - Incapacitation 
 - Corruption (system modification)
 - Obstruction (interfere with communication)

Usurpation (unauthorized system control)
 - Misappropriation (theat of service)
   -- e.g., an app that uses your resources to mine bitcoin without your consent
            like a webpage that has scripts that get run on your machine
 - Misuse (unauthorized system access)


Youtube video: can have malware on machine connected to a hotspot 
which is fully encrypted
(inference attack)
and it can track what users type

2 types of attack: active and passive
 + active - attacker affects a target system's operation
 + passive - attacker learn information without affecting system 

2 kinds of origins: authorized users nad unauthorized
 - first case they are doing bad things
 - second case they have gained access they shouldnt have


A Replay attack is an active attack
 - Alice sends Bob a signed email containing $100
 - Bob knows email is authenticated, so he deposits the money
 - Sam, another agent, has access to their comms (maybe its a local network)
   maybe he is on ISP level or he is just sniffing around the network
 - Sam can take the money from the account, send the same message to Bob and repeat this process

Message itself does not have a timestamp, so Sam can replay the message Alice sent to Bob 
Sam is actively involved -- he is receiving and sending the message w/r/t Bob
