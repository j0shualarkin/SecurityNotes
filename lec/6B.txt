illegal queries : 

manuall defensive coding practices: doing input validation
  - input typechecking: to check that inputs that are uspposed to be numeric contian no characters 
    other than digits
  - pattern matching : to distinguish noraml input from abnormal input

paramterized query insert:
allows that app dev to more accurately specify the structure of an sql query and pass the parameters 
to it separately such that any unsanitary user-input is not allowed to modify the query structure.

sql dom: a set of apis that enables automated data type validation and escaping. always typecheck



sqli detection:
signature based: attempts to match specific attack patterns. such an approach must be constantly updated and may no work against sel-fmodifying attacks

anomaly based: attempts to define normal behavior and then detect behavior patterns outside 
  the normal range. there is training phase, in which the systme learns the range of 
  normal behavior, followed by the actual detection phase

code analysis: code analysis tehcniques involve the use of aa test suite to detect sqli 
  vulenerabilites.
the test suite is designed to generate a wide range of SQLi attacks an dassess the response of 
the system

Roadmap:

web security basics

cross-site scripting attack

cross site request forgery

==

Web: collection of app-layer services used to distribute content
   - web content (HTML), multimedia, email, instant messaging
   - many applications: news outlets, entertainment, educaiton, research and technology
        commerical

The high bits
 - largest distributed system in existence
  - threats are as diverse as applications and users
  - but need to be thought out carefully


Web security
- client-server communication security
  - ssl: two phases -- connection establishment, data transfer
- server secuirty
   - sql injection attack
   - cross site scripting (XSS) attack
   - cross site request forgery
- client security
  - drive-by downloads
  - browser security


Security consideratoin
 - cookie
 - dynamic content
    + cgi
    + embedded scripting : ASP/JSP/PHP 
- client web content
  + plug-in j
  javascript
  activex
  authenticode
  java


Same origin policy
 - foundation for browser security
 - scripts on pages from the same domains can access to these pages
 - those from different domains are not allowed to access each other

How to get SOP wrong in java ::
the only network cxn an untrusted applet can make is to connect back to its homesite. 
here is the SOP of netsacpe 2.0
 + use dns to translate the name of the web server into a list of IP addrs
 + use DNS to translate the name of the machine the applaet wants to connect to into a list o fIP addrs
 + compare the two lists. if any address appears in both lists, declare the two machines are the same and allow the connection. if not,  declare they are different and refuse the connection
