Attacks

active - affect a target system's operation
passive - learn information w/o affecting system
insider - authorized user do bad things
outsider - unauthorized parties gain access

active attack is a replay attack

passive attack is exploiting a side-channel leak
-- put info in google health
-- eavesdropper can gather all the encrypted information and decrypt it

======

CIA Triad

Confidentiality - info is protected from unintended disclosure
  data - info is not disclosed to unauth. parties
  parties - control of one's own info disclosure

Integrity - system and data are maintained in a correct and consistent condition
  data - info and code only changed by auth. parties
  system - system operates w/o unauth. interference

Availability - systems and data are usable when needed

======

More security goals....

* a secure system needs to balance confidentiality, integrity and availability
* these goals may overlap or be exclusive, dependent on the situations

--- making lots of backups is good for availability but raises risk of confidentiality compromise

Additional security goals...

* authenticity - property of being verified and trusted (e.g., authentication)
* accountability - action uniquely traced back to the responsible party
  - e.g., nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection prevention, etc.

how to achieve your security goals

security controls - including policy and (enforcing) mechanicsm

security policy
 - a formal statement of rules and practices
 - specify how information assets are protected

security mechanism
 - method, tool or procedure for enforcin the security policy

 - cryptographic primitives
   -- encryption helps achieve confidentiality
   -- digital signature helps achieve integrity
   -- client puzzle may helps achieve availability ***********
 - security protocols
   -- authentiation
   -- access control

just encryption isnt amazing. 
if you know the size and packet sequences,
=> you can get the message (fancy name for this?)


***********************

want to prevent dos attack (like syn flood)
crypto approach to solve dos problem
using crypto graphic puzzle (proof of work mechanism).

when half open connection about to be filled up:
server will send client puzzzle to solve,
solving it will burn some of client cpu's 
only when client answer (correctly) will server serve resource 

if bad guy cont. "say hello", then they solve a lot of puzzles (slows them down)
  ==> makes them unable to produce so many malicious requests

More security mechanisms

security systems
 - software security
 - network security
 - privacy preserving system

Incentive engineering
 - consider human factors



tor server/client: stepping stone help u forward yr message to 
  website and relay website responses back to you

techniques to preserve your data privacy with servers you upload info to

homomorphic (sp?) data
on top of any function, encrypt data
very slow tho, 6-9 order of magnitude slowdown /=

trust exclusion environment
- have some face intel (??)
- upload data, fully encr to amazon . amazon can build up trust exclsuion env,
data can only be decrypted w/in the env
when results are sent out of env, they are encrypted again (internally they are decrypted)

intel has secret key, amazon has your enc data.
can only get your data if they collude
