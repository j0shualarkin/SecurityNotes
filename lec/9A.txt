Malware : malicious software designed to damage or disrupt a system 
 - can modify or even delete files, squander computing resources, spy on information
 -- squander resources for some purpose, like unauthorized cryptocurrency mining

---------------
Types of Malware 
---------------
- virus 
  + parasitic malicious code to legitimate software, floppy floppy (?)

- worm
  + program spreads thru the Internet

- spyware, botnet, backdoor...
  + use your resources [to get money]
  ++ private data, cpu cycles, bandwidth, etc.

-------------------
History of Malware
-------------------

1940s: von Neuman described self-reproducing automata 
 - important feature of malware

1962: Bell Lab fellows created "Darwin" (darvin?)
 - program to trace and destroy opponents' program and multiply itself

1970s: the Creeper worm was detected on ARPANET 
 - apranet is ancestor of modern internet 
 - self-spreading program ; early version of worm
 - automatically gain access and display a message 
 - the Reaper came out: searched and destroyed every Creeper it detected 

1986: first real-world spread of virus across "IBM-compatible" computers
 - called Brain 
 - developed by 19 y/o Pakistani programmer and his brother A
 -- purpose was experimental and to expose weaknesses 
 -- virus included a text with brothers' names, address and telephone number 
 - later another version of Brain came out that destroyed files on your computer 

1988: Morris worm 

1990: first polymorphic virus: the Chameleon family

1999: worm spread throug hemails 
 - purpose is more to flex tech skills  - Prof Wang 
 - [[golden age of worm-ware]]

2001: worm epidemics happens:
 - examples: Code-Red (brought down white house webpage, forced them to move their webpage)
    -- Nimda 
 - spread through ICQ, IRC, MSN messenger 

2003: Sapphire or Slammer 
 - a lot faster now, took 30 minutes to spread across the world 
 -- had a bug, if it didn't have one it could've been faster
 --- in its pseudo-random number generator
 - would look at all of IPv4 space to find new/next targets
 - aggressive spreading uses a lot of bandwidth (exhausted) 
 -- causes an [accidental] DoS

2004: Mydoom
 - get an email, click on attachment and become "zombie"
 -- then you're computer is used in DoS attack

Now (few years ago):
 - went from showing off to trying to make money
 -- spyware related ID theft, phishing ...
 -- botnet based spam, extortion ...
 -- today, you can buy access to thousands of hosts in black markets at $0.03/computer

IoT malware: 
 - infect IoT devices and launch DoS attack
 - to infect: list of vulnerabilities to go through 
 -- device that only used default user id/password are easily acessible 
 -- you should read manual and figure out how to change the passwords
 -- attackers will have resource on the default passwords and can access
 
2014/2018: [somewhere in that range] 
 - Rutgers had a DoS atack 
 - took advantage of Single-Sign-On Service 
 - journalists said it could have been _some person_, then they got DDoS'd // journalists or the named person?
 -- FBI ultimately found the culprits 


================================================================================
-----------------
Morris Worm
-----------------

caused damage accidentally 

can duplicate/spread itself 

used vulnerabilities:
 - debug option of sendmail
 - gets, used in the implementation of finger
 - remote logins .rhost files 

took control of system programs; spread really fast/far
 @ Berkeley on their Unix system

big factor in the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)

perp was convicted under Fraud and Abuse Act of 1988
 - 3 yrs probation, 400 hrs comm service, $10050 fine and cost of his supervision
 - now a professor at MIT, lol

                                 ----------
                                  Viruses
                                 ----------

Where do they hide?  How to trigger them?
* Program virus -- whenever the program is run

* Boot sector virus --

* Other, e.g. macro virus
-- some place on hard disk
-- executable code in documents, such as word macro


---------------
Program Virus
---------------

- append its code to the beginning of a program
 -- system will run the virus code first and then move to the program code

- insert its code to the appropriate place of a program
-- eliminate the inconsistency of program size

- replace some code in a program
-- requires in-depth knowledge of target program

- add jumps/gotos in the code to point to the virus code

* has become more rare over time bc our software systems now are much safer than they used to be
** running code on Android/iOS is sandboxed, so programs have no communication with each other 
** and app is served off AppStore which does checks; GooglePlay Store is a bit looser than Apple but still does some checks (?)

* you could download app, decompile it, 
  add code, recompile then upload as a new app to marketplace

---------------
Boot Virus
---------------

- hides inside system bootstrap mechanism
-- e.g., between firmware and bootstrap loader 
- activates whenever the system reboots, runs its malware, 
-- then run the remaining part of start-up procedure

---------------
Other
---------------

- use file pointers 
-- attacker change pointer to file to point to virus, then have virus point to the file 

- macro in MS office
-- virus hides inside macro, startup macro runs everytime the program is executed

- libraries 
-- hide in a function that allows virus to be trigered whenever a program calls that function
--- malicious javascripts


================================================================================

---------------
Virus Signatures
---------------

- virus cannot be completely invisible; code must be stored somewhere

- code executes in some way, using certain method to spread
-- leaves traces on the data it manages, called *signatures*

- signature can be used to identify the existence of that virus

----------------------------------------
Anti-Antivirus & Anti-Anti-Antivirus
----------------------------------------
- a simple virus is easy to detect
-- check its static isngature, a scanner can identify the virus

Anti-Antivirus
- dynamically change their signatures to evade detection
-- e.g., encrypte dviruses and polymorphic viruses

Anti-Anti-Antivirus
- development of virus detection technologies against these advanced viruses

----------------------------------------
Virus Concealment Categories
----------------------------------------
encryption virus - use encryption for hiding its content
 -- idea: hiding the fixed signatures by scrambling the virus
 -- each malware uses a key to encrypt the body 
 -- so virus needs key, code that encrypts, and code that decrypts 
** can capture by finding the decrypter code, it must be saved as plaintext in the virus

stealth - use code mutation, compression, et.c to hide

polymorphic - create functionally-equivalent copies

metamorphic virus - mutates with every infection
